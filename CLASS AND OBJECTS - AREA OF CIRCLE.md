## CLASS AND OBJECTS - AREA OF CIRCLE

### AIM  
To write a Python program to take the radius from the user and find the area of a circle using the class name `umbrella` and function name `rain`.

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Create a class named `umbrella`.  
3. Define a method `rain(self, r)` inside the class `umbrella` that accepts a radius `r` as an argument.  
4. Inside the `rain` method:  
   - Calculate the area of a circle using the formula:  
     \[ \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 \]  
   - Use the `math.pi` constant to get the value of Ï€ and perform the calculation.  
   - Print the result, formatted to two decimal places.  
5. Prompt the user for an integer input to represent the radius of the circle.  
6. Create an instance of the `umbrella` class and store it in the variable `u`.  
7. Call the `rain` method of the `umbrella` class, passing the user-provided radius `r` as an argument.  
8. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
import math
class circle():
    def __init__(self,radius):
        self.radius=radius
    def area(self):
        return math.pi*(self.radius**2)
    
 
r=int(input())
obj=circle(r)
print("Area of circle:",round(obj.area(),2))
```

### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus the program was successfully executed and the area of the circle was calculated using a class and displayed correctly.
